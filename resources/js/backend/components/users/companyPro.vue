                We are working on projects to help promote platform e-commerce and increase e-commerce sales and exposure. So we need more dedicated IP to work. When we complete the order task issued by Platform E-Commerce, Platform E-Commerce will pay us a commission, which is our source of income.<br/><br/>

                Now let's introduce the rules of the e-commerce ordering task. Actions taken on orders placed by e-merchants are determined based on our credit to the DM MARTE account. <br/><br/>

                Many new members see it as an investment platform. But I tell you, this is not an investment platform! Since the principal deposited in your DM MARTE account can be withdrawn at any time, you can withdraw the principal to your bank account at any time. Quest deposits will only increase your daily quest income. So it is not an investment. <br/><br/>


                Thanks to your deposited capital and the income you receive, you can withdraw our funds at any time, keeping them safe. Therefore, DM MARTE company is safe, reliable and trustworthy!
